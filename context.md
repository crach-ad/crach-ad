# Project Context

- **Project Goal**: Update the public speaking page (/public-speaking)
- **Image Updates**: Updated both the HEALinc Summit image (to `/images/healinc-future-health-summit.jpg`) and the EdVolution Symposium image (to `/images/edvolutionpic.jpg`) on the website.
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Initial Setup**: Moved existing page content from `app/page.tsx` to `app/public-speaking/page.tsx` to establish the correct route.
- **April 2025 Update**: Added the Bahamas Business Outlook 2020 event to the public speaking page, including details about the presentation on AI's impact on education. Used the existing businessoutlook.png image for the event card.
