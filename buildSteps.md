# Build Steps

1.  **Setup Public Speaking Route**: Created the `/public-speaking` route by moving the page content from `app/page.tsx` to `app/public-speaking/page.tsx`.
2.  **Update Event Images**: Updated image references for both the HEALinc Summit section (to `/images/healinc-future-health-summit.jpg`) and the EdVolution Symposium section (to `/images/edvolutionpic.jpg`).
3.  **Add Bahamas Business Outlook 2020 Event**: Added a new speaking event to the public speaking page, including event details, presentation focus, and styling consistent with existing events.
